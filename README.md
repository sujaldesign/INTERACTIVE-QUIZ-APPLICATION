*Task Description*
For this task, I developed an interactive quiz application using JavaScript that allows users to answer questions and receive instant feedback in a clean and engaging interface. The main goal of the project was to create a polished frontend experience with dynamic question loading and real-time scoring.
The quiz loads questions dynamically from predefined question sets related to frontend development topics. Instead of hardcoding content in the UI, questions and options are rendered using JavaScript, which makes the application flexible and easy to extend. Each quiz session presents one question at a time, keeping the interface simple and focused.
To enhance user engagement, the application includes a real-time scoring system that updates instantly based on user responses. When a user selects an answer, the application provides immediate visual feedback: correct answers are highlighted with a green glow, while incorrect answers are highlighted with a red glow. This clear feedback helps users quickly understand their performance.
Technologies Used

HTML5 for structure

CSS3 for styling, animations, and visual effects

JavaScript for logic, state management, and DOM manipulation
Overall, this project demonstrates strong frontend fundamentals, including dynamic DOM manipulation, state management, user interaction handling, and polished UI feedback. It delivers a complete quiz application.
