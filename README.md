*Task Description*
For this task, I developed an interactive quiz application using JavaScript that allows users to answer questions and receive instant feedback in a clean and engaging interface. The main goal of the project was to create a polished frontend experience with dynamic question loading and real-time scoring.
  Dynamic Question Loading

Questions are loaded dynamically from predefined datasets.

No hardcoded UI content, making the quiz scalable and flexible.

Real-Time Scoring System

Score updates instantly based on user responses.

Correct and incorrect answers are visually distinguished.

Visual Feedback

Correct answers are highlighted with a green glow.

Incorrect selections are highlighted with a red glow.

Disabled options prevent multiple selections per question.

Per-Question Timer

Each question includes a 60-second countdown timer.

Timer is displayed using a circular progress indicator.

Visual warning is shown when time is below 10 seconds.

Automatically moves to the next question if time runs out.

Result Analysis

Displays final performance using an animated circular progress bar.

Shows score percentage with color-coded feedback.

Provides clear performance labels (e.g., Excellent, Good, Needs Improvement).

Restartable Quiz Flow

Users can restart the quiz without refreshing the page.

Score, timer, and UI states reset correctly on restart.
